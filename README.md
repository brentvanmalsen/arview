## Introduction

Augmented Reality (AR) is a technology that merges digital objects to the real world, while viewing it from the camera of your device. Users can view their selected images as if they are placed inside the image, using their mobile device as a viewing window.

## Features

- **Image Selection:** Users can select images from their device's gallery using the "Open app gallery" button on the app's home screen.
  
- **AR View:** After selecting an image, users can view it in the AR environment by pressing the "Use image in AR" button on the preview screen. This opens an AR view where the image is displayed as a big sphere.

- **Real-time Interaction:** Users can move their mobile device to move inside but also outside of the sphere. It is possible to view the image from different angles.
